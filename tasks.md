### Bugs
- Screensharing doesn't work on KDE when hyprland is also added.
  - probably some shenanigans with `xdg-desktop-portal`

### General
- nixify kde plasma (mainly for keybindings)
- tofi for kde?

### Hyprland tasks
- screenshotting
- clipboard manager
- blue light filter
- figure out brightnessctl. Mainly for hypridle.
- (nice to have) media control in hypr lock screen
